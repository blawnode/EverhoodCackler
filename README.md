# EverhoodCackler
 A Custom Battle for the Everhood anniversary contest.
 Go to blawnode / EverhoodCackler / assets / Cackler for the actual mod folder.
 
 If you generate the chart data, but it won't actually save, I did this to ensure the save (some steps may be redundant):
 - Disable and re-enable the chart data game object.
 - Open another scene (say, the one in blawnode / EverhoodCackler / assets / TokyoBliss), and return to the current scene.
 Only then, I dim it safe to build the mod.
